The Problem that me and my partner have decided to look into is the gap in  
knowledge associated with plant composition in forests and 
meadows and the relationship that has to pollinator density in these 
specific areas. We also intend to look into how over management of 
forests can actually lead to pollinator decline. With this gap we are 
unable to understand the extent improper management and invasive species
have on the density of pollinators in a given area. One study from 2009 
stated that “the impact of non-native invasive plants on biodiversity has been well described, in terms of the structure of native plant communities, little is known on how they might influence other species, including those that play critical functional roles, such as pollinators” (Mciver et al, 2009). This is where the problem lies, we don’t know the broader importance of pollinator plant interactions within a given
ecosystem and how disturbances to said ecosystem, such as the introduction of nonnative plants, over management, and agricultural plots being planted. So, our goal is to take a deeper look at these interactions and map out the commonalities that are found throughout our data sets.There are quite a few  studies who have addressed the different issues we intend to look at, much of the research was done through

Many different studies have been done that address the different aspects of what we intend to look at in our project, the main sources of additional data we have collect comes from a long term study done at the Andrews Experimental Forest (Pfeiffer, 2021). Though many of these studies were conducted through Oregon State University in collaboration with their forestry and soil science departments.This one is where much of the data we are cross referencing with the OBA data is coming from. Other researchers have looked at the effects that pollinators have on invasive plants and how they can actually help spread them because of the plant- pollinatior interacting.It also shows what would happen if the pollinators were removed completely from the equations. (Mciver, et al. 2009). We also have background information to help with the simulation in regards to the introduction of pollinator to an agricultural setting and how the additon of crops can increase the population of bees.
